                        <h3>METALS AND MINING</h3>
                        <p>The key industries named Metals, Minerals, and Mining are an integral part of infrastructure
                            development in India. India ranked fourth among coal producers and third largest steel
                            producer. With this record, the future of the industry looks promising as there are still
                            large reserves of minerals and metals unexplored. Demand has increased in the metals,
                            minerals, and mining industries to acquire professional talent. To meet the growing demand
                            for professional human resources, we are the best solution provider and provide quality
                            services to our clients. We at Humantroop Ventures observe and understand the growth

                        <h3>Metals & Mining Industries</h3>
                        <p>The metals & Mining industry broadly refers to the extraction of metals and minerals (mining)
                            and the primary and secondary processing of those metals and minerals. The industry is very
                            global in structure, with a few manufacturers accounting for the lion's share of production.
                            Diversified metals and mining companies supply commodities used in products and equipment
                            found in a wide range of industries such as construction, automotive, aerospace, and
                            telecommunications. The reach is so broad that metal utilization rates are a key barometer
                            for measuring the health of the global economy. The lack of talent is part of the human
                            capital problem in the sector.</p>
                        <p>Humantroop Ventures can help, whether you require a single executive or a full team for your
                            new mining project, we have the complete expertise to meet these needs. We have a team of
                            consultants with experience in the mining industry to help you. Our experience includes

                            positions worldwide. Many international search firms can effectively search for CEOs, COOs,
                            and CFOs, but few truly understand how to find the best process manager or subway
                            specialist. To meet the demand for skilled human resources in this highly specialized
                            sector, we find ourselves as the best talent search providers to bring value to our clients.
