                            Human Resource Management (HRM) is considered an integral part of business operations and
                            hence the need for management to design a structured HRM program. As this aviation industry
                            provides a pleasant and convenient mode of transportation to its clients, its workforce is
                            crucial. Although the workforce of the airline industry faces various challenges due to
                            economic fluctuations, it is the presence of a strong union framework in the airline segment
                            that prevents employees from being exploited by the airlines and their management.</p>
                            
                        <p> HRM examines the system's strengths and weaknesses to determine the competitive landscape of
                            the airline industry. Aviation is extremely competitive but safe and responsive and has a
                            high technology service industry. It plays the role of strategy, mutually supporting culture
                            change, new generation of leadership talent and change of strategic business partners and
                            leads to positive change.</p>
