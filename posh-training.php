                                <h5>The Government of India introduced the Workplace Sexual Harassment of Women Act (also colloquially known as the "POSH Act"), 2013 in India to effectively deal with matters related to sexual harassment of women in their workplace.</h5>
                                <p>The POSH Act mandates that every organization with more than 10 employees must establish an Internal Committee (IC) that can facilitate complaints about sexual harassment of women in the workplace. Another critical requirement is coaching ICs on their responsibilities as well as creating awareness among staff and through regular POSH training. Our POSH trainings have helped employers identify potential areas of sexual harassment of women in the workplace and address them effectively. These sessions aim to educate IC members and staff about the various forms of sexual harassment and the redressal mechanism, thereby instilling confidence in them to speak up if they witness any inappropriate behavior with a sexual overtone.</p>
